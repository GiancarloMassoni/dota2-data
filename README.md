# Dota 2 Data

A web application for Dota 2 players who want to view their career statistics, matches, and characters played.

I created this project because Dota 2 is my favorite game and I wanted to make a way to view personal statistics for past matches played, total career stats and each individual character stats. I wanted any player to have a quick way to view these things and show off to their friends there stats.
